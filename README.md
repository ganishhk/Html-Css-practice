# HTML & CSS Practice

This repository is my personal learning space while I build my frontend foundation.

I’m learning **HTML and CSS seriously**, step by step, by writing code myself, breaking things, fixing them, and understanding *why* things work — not just watching tutorials.

---

## What this repo is about

This repo contains:
- My **daily HTML & CSS practice**
- Small UI components like:
  - Navigation bars
  - Card layouts
  - Buttons and hover effects
- Layout practice using **Flexbox**
- Experiments with spacing, alignment, colors, and structure

Most files are simple on purpose — I’m focusing on **fundamentals**, because strong basics matter more than flashy projects.

## Where I am right now

Right now, I:
- Understand HTML structure well
- Can build layouts using **Flexbox**
- Know how to align items, space them properly, and make basic responsive layouts
- Am starting to add **hover effects and transforms**
- Am practicing regularly to improve speed and confidence

I’m still learning, but I’m consistent and improving every day.

## Why this repo exists

I created this repository to:
- Track my progress publicly
- Build discipline by pushing code regularly
- Show my learning journey honestly
- Prepare myself for **internships and real projects**

This repo is not about perfection — it’s about **growth**.

My short-term goals:
- Get very comfortable with Flexbox & CSS layouts
- Start CSS Grid alongside Flexbox
- Learn JavaScript and DOM manipulation
- Build interactive projects (no copy-paste)

My long-term goal:
- Become a confident frontend developer
- Get a good internship
- Build real, useful web projects

## Final note

If you’re reading this:
I’m still learning, still improving, and still showing up.

This repo will keep growing as I grow.
